* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
What would happen if there was a merge conflict.
The fetch command.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Branching allows multiple developers to work on different features of the same program at the same time.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What the "origin" part of git push origin branch was about.
What makes good comments on commits.

* What still confuses you about Git?
I'm a little confused about the use of the fetch command, but I feel like I will come to understand it as I use it more.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Unfortunately I didn't have a pair for this. It was difficult doing this on my own and a bit intimidating. I'm looking forward to future GPS's with a partner. I may try to do future GPS's at a time that isn't right after a day of work.
